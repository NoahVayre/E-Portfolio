        <p class="lead-paragraph">
          Joining the robotics club allowed me to bring my curiosity for electronics and autonomous systems to life.
          I take part in designing and programming autonomous robots capable of movement and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience has taught me how to combine technical precision with creativity, particularly through motor control 
          and power management. Working as a team on real systems has strengthened my problem-solving skills in hands-on conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My next goal is to take part in the <a href="https://www.eurobot.org/">Eurobot</a> competition
          and mentor new members in embedded electronics.

        <p class="lead-paragraph">
          3D printing allows me to connect digital design to physical reality.
          I conducted an experimental study on the mechanical resistance of printed cubes depending on their infill rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this project, I deepened my skills in CAD using 
          <a href="https://www.solidworks.com/">SolidWorks</a> and <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/">CATIA</a>,
          as well as slicing with <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Cura</a>.
          It also taught me how to plan an experiment and analyze real data rigorously.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, I would like to explore more sustainable materials and see how additive manufacturing
          can support responsible production.

          Taking part in the <a href="https://www.2tonnes.org/en/">Atelier 2 Tonnes</a> workshop helped me better understand climate issues 
          and the role engineers can play in the ecological transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through collaborative scenarios, I was able to measure how individual and collective decisions can shape our environmental future.
          This experience helped me connect my technical skills to a broader awareness of sustainability.

        <p class="lead-paragraph">
          Sports play a central role in my personal balance.
          Practicing <strong>Viet Vo Dao</strong> has taught me discipline, respect, and self-control,
          while <strong>weight training</strong> has strengthened my sense of perseverance, structure, and mental focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          These activities help me channel my energy and maintain both physical and mental endurance, 
          which directly influences the way I approach studies and engineering projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to keep developing this balance between physical well-being and intellectual engagement, 
          as I believe both are essential to becoming a complete engineer.
