- **Role**: <leader / team member>
- **Tools & Tech**: <Matlab, Python, SolidWorks, 3D printing...>
- **Short description** (2-3 lines)
  > Replace this with a brief summary: goal, what you built/tested.
- **Results**
  - Measurable outcomes: e.g. "reduced weight by 12%" or "withstood X N".

  - What I learned technically
  - What I would improve next time
  - Skills gained (teamwork, CAD, experimental design)

*(Repeat for at least one completed project — the rubric demande au moins un projet technique avec réflexion.)*
