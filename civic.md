# Sustainability & Civic Engagement

- **Ongoing or past activities**: (e.g., volunteer tutoring, clean-up campaigns, association work)
- **Planned actions**: (projects you want to initiate or join)
- **Why it matters to me**: short personal motivation
- **Skills & impact**: what you learn and how it connects to engineering (leadership, project management)
