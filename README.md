# Welcome to my E-Portfolio  

Hello! My name is Noah Vayre, I am currently a third-year engineering student at ENSEEIHT (specialising in Electronics, Energy and Automation).  

This e-portfolio showcases my academic projects, international mobility plans, civic engagement, extracurricular activities, and my career development journey.  

It is designed to reflect my learning path, personal goals and the skills I am developing during my studies.
